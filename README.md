# Find-Them

## Inspiration

We wanted to build something that could potentially be adopted by the general public working around an increasing social-issue. We think this kind of tools can generate impact among communities and help leverage the "mass-addaption".

## What it does

findthem.network is a decentralized network for finding missing children. It gives parents and legal guardians an easy-to-use decentralized application for posting information and offering incentives to the network in exchange for help.

**Main Features**

- Open new cases providing.
- Support a case through donation. These donations are then used to extend the search reach.
- Anonymous submission of hints that only parents can read.
- Grant access to third-parties so that they can follow a case progress.
- Approval or rejection of hints by parents.
- Gas refund to collaborators on parents on approval of the submitted hint.
- Sensitive data deletion when a case is solved. Only aggregated data remains in the blockchain for statistical purposes.
- Approved collaborators can redeem the incentive or donate it to the network.
- Automatic distribution of the balance to other geographically close cases.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Buidling a social dapp with real-world social impact.
- Preserving anonymity of hint's provider.
- Avoiding hint manipulation by third-parties.
- Accepting donations to spread the word.
- Increase collaboration by offering rewards.

## What's next for findthem.network

**We would love to see these concepts evolve:**

- Use push-notifications to notify all "subscribers" in the nearbys of an accepted hint location. There could also be incentives for people that help spread the word by sharing in other networks.
- Obfuscate incentives amount to avoid misconducts of the users.
* Encrypt hints to ensure privacy for the Finding Request owner.
- Using a stable coin would be a good feature in order to preserve the value of economic incentives in the long-run.
- A few things around centralization in our project could be resolved with DAO governance mechanisms.
