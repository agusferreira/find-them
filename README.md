# Find-Them

## ETHBerlin Hackathon project

### Summary
We developed a network for finding missing children, giving the parents an easy-to-use decentralized application for posting information and offer incentives for the network to help.
Assuring anonymity in the hints from the network, accepting donations for more incentives and advertisement, and collaborating with the network after the request is finished to create sinergy.
Collaborators are refunded for their costs, and could get incentives if they wanted to. A share of the balance is given to the network for other active posts and parents are refunded the remaining balance.

Find the project deployed in the Rinkeby Network at https://foundthem.network

## Main Features
* Create Find Requests
* Donate to a Find Request
* Submit Hints to a Find Request
* Approve or reject Hints
* Close a Find Request
* Refund Gas costs to all collaborators
* Approved collaborators can redeem the incentive or donate it to the network
* Parents can retrieve the remaining balance or donate it to the network
* Automatic distribution of the balance to other geographically close Find Request

## Next Steps
* Change to a StableCoin (DAI) instead of ETH to ensure incentives & refunds
* Obfuscate incentives amount to avoid misconducts of the users
* Encrypt hints to ensure privacy for the Finding Request owner
* Use network donations for advertising in an autonomous way through a decentralized network
* Replace off-chain server (that stores sensitive data) for a private blockchain
